This work is implementation of RDF2Rule work 

```Wang, Z. and Li, J., 2015. RDF2Rules: Learning rules from RDF knowledge bases by mining frequent predicate cycles. arXiv preprint arXiv:1512.07734.```

We divided the whole algorithm into three major subtasks as follows: 

* Finding Frequent Predicate Cycles (FPCs)
* Adding Type Information to the entities in FPCs
* Rule Generation.
